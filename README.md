# LogsAnalysis
# My ambition is to create a smart tool which can help on engineers trouble-shooting work.
# New Terms to help understanding the project
# Logline:  This name is self-descriptive.  A log file content is composed with multiple Loglines
# LogBlock:  A LogBlock is a batch of Loglines which have some relationships or have some attributs. 
# Event  :  A event is a batch of Loglines/LogBlocks which can describe something happened in the system. For example: a peer node loose connection
#
# The idea of my ambition is: All problems can be described as events happened and fit to timeline. A working system could also be described same.
# compare this too events, then we can know that something diffirent, then that's the first analyzing entrance
